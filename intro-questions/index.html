        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Jin Park, Junior Double majoring in Communication Design and Film with a minor in HCI.</p>
        <p>2. I want to learn more about HTML and CSS</p>
        <p>3. I took WebDev.</p>
        <p>4. How to create an aesthetically pleasing website.</p>
        <p>5. There are some backend elements that work behind the scenes to make a website work.</p>
        <p>6. <a href="https://shantellmartin.art/">Shantell Martin</a> "Shantell Martin is an amazing artist. Her website embodies her style in a creative way that is an explorative experience for users. I love how elements interact with your cursor. The transitions are really smooth and makes users want to explore.</p>
        <p>7. <a href="https://www.nbbj.com/">nbbj</a> "I really enjoy looking through nbbj's website. As an architectural firm they focus a lot on communicating what they do as a company in a intriguing way with transitional videos and overlayed text. The website definitely has a lot of coding involved but I love how seemless everything feels.</p>
        <p>8. <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> "I love Apple's product pages, as you scroll the products move and show information aesthetically and efficiently. Most people might thnk this takes a lot of rendering and coding but Apple actually uses thousands of jpegs to make it seem like its a seemless render but in reality you're scolling through images. This also helps Apple show their products on any device. It would take a lot of computing power for a browser to actually render and process all those actions. The structure of the website is also easy to navigate.</p>
